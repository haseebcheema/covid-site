                <h1><strong>COVID-19</strong></h1>
                <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious
                    disease caused by a new virus.</p>
                    <p>The disease causes respiratory illness (like the
                        flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and
                        in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You
                        can protect yourself by washing your hands
                        frequently, avoiding touching your face, and
                        avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with
                        people who are unwell.</p>
                        <h4><strong>How it spreads?</strong></h4>
                        <p>Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through
                            contact with an infected person when they
                            cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person
                            touches a surface or object that has the virus
                            on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
